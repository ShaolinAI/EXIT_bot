EXIT_bot is a powerful networking tool developed by the EXIT Men's Networking Group to enhance networking capabilities through the use of AI. The tool primarily consists of an IPython notebook script (`EXIT_bot.ipynb`) that creates a ChromaDB collection of user details. The collection can be queried using plain text, providing a seamless and efficient way to search for users based on various criteria.

## Features

- **ChromaDB Collection**: The IPython notebook script efficiently creates and manages a ChromaDB collection containing user details. This database allows for quick and accurate retrieval of information.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can easily search the ChromaDB collection using plain text queries. This feature streamlines the process of finding relevant networking connections.

- **Streamlit App**: The repo includes a Streamlit app (`streamlit_app.py`) that complements the functionality of the IPython notebook script. However, please note that the Streamlit app is currently unfinished, and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with EXIT_bot:

1\. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/exitmensnetworking/EXIT_bot.git

   cd EXIT_bot

   ```

2\. Open and run the `ChromaDB_local.ipynb` script in your preferred IPython environment.

3\. Explore the Streamlit app by running:

   ```bash

   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

   ```

   Please note that additional development may be needed to complete the app.
